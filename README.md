# digital-clock

This digital clock was made in vanilla javascript. 

This is done for a project at NYCDA. The instructions are as follows:

>The hex clock is a hex code that reflects the time of day in #hhmmss format instead of hh:mm:ss format. The background color of the >screen is then changed based on the hex code which is created by the current time.

Here is the grading criteria:
1. JS clock is fully functional and throws zero errors
2. The time is in digital format to resemble a hex code
3. The time is displayed centered in the middle of the screen
4. The screen background color changes based on the current time
